## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/microservices-deployment-pipeline.git
cd microservices-deployment-pipeline

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/AMINE7119/microservices-deployment-pipeline.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

# Install dependencies
make install-deps

# Set up local Kubernetes
make setup-local-k8s

# Run tests to ensure everything works
make test
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
# Always work on a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

## üìù Development Process

### 1. Before You Start
- **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
- **Open an issue** for major changes to discuss approach
- **Read relevant documentation** in the `docs/` folder
- **Understand the architecture** by reviewing system design docs

### 2. Development Standards

#### Code Quality Requirements
- **Follow existing code style** in each service
- **Add appropriate tests** (unit, integration, e2e as needed)
- **Update documentation** for any user-facing changes
- **Ensure security best practices** are followed
- **Add appropriate logging** and error handling

#### Language-Specific Guidelines

**Frontend (React/Vue.js)**
```bash
# Run linting and formatting
npm run lint
npm run format

# Ensure tests pass
npm test

# Check bundle size impact
npm run build
```

**API Gateway & Order Service (Node.js)**
```bash
# Follow existing ESLint rules
npm run lint

# Ensure test coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit
```

**User Service (Python)**
```bash
# Format code
black app/
isort app/

# Lint code
flake8 app/

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-fail-under=80

# Security check
bandit -r app/
```

**Product Service (Go)**
```bash
# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Lint code
go vet ./...

# Run tests
go test -v -race ./...

# Check for vulnerabilities
gosec ./...
```

#### Documentation Standards
- **Update README.md** if adding new features
- **Add phase documentation** if implementing new phases
- **Include code examples** in documentation
- **Write clear commit messages**
- **Add inline comments** for complex logic

#### Security Requirements
- **No secrets in code** - use environment variables or Vault
- **Scan for vulnerabilities** before submitting
- **Follow security best practices** for your language/framework
- **Update security documentation** if needed

### 3. Testing Your Changes

#### Required Tests Before Submission
```bash
# Unit tests (must pass)

make test-integration

# Full validation (recommended for major changes)
make validate
```
