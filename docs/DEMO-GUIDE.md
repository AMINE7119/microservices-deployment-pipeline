## 🎤 Interview Demo Tips

### Before the Interview
- [ ] **Test Everything**: Full demo run 30 minutes before
- [ ] **Prepare Backups**: Screenshots and videos ready
- [ ] **Know Your Metrics**: Memorize key numbers
- [ ] **Practice Timing**: Demo should be 5-10 minutes max
- [ ] **Prepare Questions**: Anticipate technical questions

### During the Demo
- **Start Strong**: Lead with impressive metrics
- **Keep It Moving**: Don't get stuck on one issue
- **Explain While Doing**: Narrate your actions
- **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Live demos beat slides
- **End with Impact**: Always close with business value

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "How would this scale to handle millions of requests?"**
**A:** "The architecture includes horizontal pod autoscaling, database read replicas, CDN integration, and caching layers. I've load tested it to 10,000 concurrent users and designed the scaling strategy for 10x that capacity."

**Q: "What happens when a service fails?"**
**A:** "Multiple layers of resilience: health checks trigger automatic restart, circuit breakers prevent cascade failures, blue-green deployments enable instant rollback, and monitoring alerts the team within seconds."

**Q: "How do you ensure security?"**
**A:** "Security is integrated throughout: SAST/DAST scans in CI/CD, container vulnerability scanning, network policies, secret management with Vault, and zero critical vulnerabilities in production."

**Q: "What's your disaster recovery strategy?"**
**A:** "Multi-region deployment, automated backups, infrastructure as code for rapid rebuild, documented runbooks, and tested recovery procedures with <4 hour RTO."

## 📱 Mobile/Remote Demo Tips

### For Phone/Video Interviews
- **Larger Fonts**: Increase terminal and browser font sizes
- **Clear Audio**: Use headset or external microphone  
- **Stable Connection**: Ethernet preferred over WiFi
