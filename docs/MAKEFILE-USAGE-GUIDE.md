## üìã Phase-by-Phase Makefile Usage

### Phase 0: Initial Project Setup

#### Step 1: Environment Verification
```bash
# Check if all dependencies are installed
make env

# Check specific dependencies
make check-deps
```

#### Step 2: Complete Project Initialization
```bash
# This command does EVERYTHING needed to start:
# - Installs all dependencies (Node.js, Python, Go)
# - Installs development tools (kubectl, helm, kind, argocd)
# - Creates local Kubernetes cluster
make init-project

# Expected output: ‚úÖ Project initialization complete!
```

**üîç What happens during init-project:**
1. `install-deps`: Installs dependencies for all 5 microservices
2. `setup-tools`: Installs kubectl, Helm, Kind, ArgoCD CLI
3. `setup-local-k8s`: Creates Kind cluster with ingress controller

#### Step 3: Verify Setup
```bash
# Show project information
make version

# Check environment status
make env
```

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Foundation Development

### Step 1: Development Environment
```bash
# Start development environment (hot reload)
make dev

# Or deploy locally with Docker Compose
make deploy-local
```

### Step 2: Building Services
```bash

make build-all

# Build specific service
make build SERVICE=frontend
make build SERVICE=api-gateway
make build SERVICE=user-service
make build SERVICE=product-service
make build SERVICE=order-service
```

### Step 3: Testing Phase 1
```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration + security)
make test

# Run specific test types
make test-unit           # Unit tests for all services
make test-integration    # Integration tests
make test-security       # Security scans
```

### Step 4: Local Deployment Verification
```bash
# Check service health
make health-check

# View service logs
make logs                      # All services
make logs SERVICE=frontend     # Specific service

# Check service status
make pipeline-status
```

### Step 5: Phase 1 Validation
```bash
# Run Phase 1 validation
make validate

# Expected output: ‚úÖ Phase 1 validation passed
```

---

## üîí Phase 2: Security Implementation

# View Kubernetes logs
make logs-k8s                    # All services
make logs-k8s SERVICE=frontend   # Specific service

# Check Kubernetes status
make pipeline-status
```

make deploy-prod
```

### Step 2: Blue-Green Deployment
```bash
# Execute blue-green deployment
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh microservices/frontend:v2.0.0

# Or use make target (after implementing in Phase 4)
make deploy-blue-green IMAGE=microservices/frontend:v2.0.0
```

### Step 3: Canary Deployment
```bash
# Deploy canary release (managed by Flagger)
# This is automated through GitOps - just push changes
git push origin main

# Monitor canary progress
kubectl get canary microservices-canary -n microservices -w
```

### Step 4: Rollback Operations
```bash
# Manual rollback if needed
kubectl rollout undo deployment/microservices -n microservices

# Or use automated rollback monitoring
./scripts/deployment/auto-rollback.sh
```

---

## üìä Phase 5: Observability & Monitoring

### Step 1: Setup Monitoring Stack
```bash
# Install Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger
make setup-monitoring

# This installs the complete observability stack
```

### Step 2: Access Monitoring Dashboards
```bash
# Show monitoring dashboard URLs
make monitoring

# Port forward to access:
# Prometheus: kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 9090:80 -n monitoring
# Grafana: kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring
# Jaeger: kubectl port-forward svc/jaeger-query 16686:16686 -n monitoring
```

### Step 3: Log Analysis
```bash
# View aggregated logs
make logs                    # Docker Compose logs
