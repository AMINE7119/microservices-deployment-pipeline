# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security First Approach

The Microservices Deployment Pipeline project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policies, procedures for reporting vulnerabilities, and the security measures implemented throughout the project.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Security Updates |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |

| Low | 2 weeks | Next release | With release notes |

### Process Flow

1. **Report Received** → Security team reviews and acknowledges
2. **Triage** → Severity assessment and impact analysis
3. **Investigation** → Detailed technical analysis
4. **Fix Development** → Patch development and testing
5. **Testing** → Security testing and validation
6. **Deployment** → Coordinated fix deployment
7. **Disclosure** → Responsible public disclosure
8. **Follow-up** → Post-incident review and improvements
